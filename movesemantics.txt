Move semantics is a new way of moving resources around in an optimal way by avoiding unnecessary copies of temporary objects, based on rvalue references. 
In my opinion, the best way to understand what move semantics is about is to build a wrapper class around a dynamic resource (i.e. a dynamically allocated pointer) 
and keep track of it as it moves in and out functions.
Keep in mind however that move semantics does not apply only to classes!
